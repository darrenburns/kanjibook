# Keybindings

This document outlines the keyboard shortcuts available in the application.

## Text Selection Shortcuts

When text is selected, the following shortcuts are available:

### Ctrl+J (Cmd+J on Mac): Search in Jisho

- If a single kanji character is selected, it opens a kanji search on Jisho.
- If multiple characters or non-kanji text is selected, it opens a regular search on Jisho.

### Ctrl+P (Cmd+P on Mac): Search in JPDB

- If a single kanji character is selected, it opens a kanji page on JPDB.
- If multiple characters or non-kanji text is selected, it opens a search page on JPDB.

### Ctrl+W (Cmd+W on Mac): Search in WaniKani

- If a single kanji character is selected, it opens the kanji page on WaniKani.
- If multiple characters or non-kanji text is selected, it opens a search page on WaniKani.

### Ctrl+L (Cmd+L on Mac): Ask AI

- This shortcut sends the selected text to the AI assistant for analysis or explanation.

## Notes

- These shortcuts are context-sensitive and only work when text is selected in the editor.
- The application detects whether you're using a Mac or another operating system and adjusts the modifier key accordingly (Command for Mac, Control for others).
- Make sure not to conflict with browser or system-wide shortcuts when using these keybindings.
